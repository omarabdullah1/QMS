# QMS (Quarantine Management System)

This is a home quarantine application to find out the date of your quarantine and to know
whether you were inside or outside the place of the quarantine through Wi-Fi and the
connection of the bracelet as worn in the hand, connected with Bluetooth, and uses a
set of algorithms using artificial intelligence and Flutter. And that was part of a research
paper made at the faculty of engineering at Helwan University.
